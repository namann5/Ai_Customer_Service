# AI Customer Service

AI + Human Hybrid Customer Support for Indian Small Businesses.

This project is a prototype for building a simple, affordable customer service system for Indian MSMEs (shops, clinics, salons, coaching centers, local services).

The goal is to let small businesses handle customer queries in Hindi / Hinglish using AI, while automatically handing over to a human when the AI is unsure.

## Why This Exists

Small Indian businesses lose customers because:
- Calls and messages are missed
- There is no 24/7 support
- Language barriers exist
- Call centers are too expensive

This project solves that by:
- Using AI for common questions
- Supporting Indian-style communication
- Allowing human takeover for complex cases
- Keeping everything simple and affordable

## What This Prototype Will Become

- A landing website for businesses  
- A simple chat interface for customers  
- FAQ-based AI replies  
- “Talk to Human” handoff  
- A demo setup for real shops  

This is not a finished product.  
It is an early-stage working prototype.
